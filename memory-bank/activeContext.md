# Active Context

## Current Phase
**üéâ PROJECT COMPLETE - Phase 9 Finished**

## What We Accomplished
Successfully completed all 9 phases of the 3D Chess Game development:

‚úÖ **Phase 0**: Foundation & Documentation Setup
‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Project Initialization (Vite + React + TypeScript)  
‚úÖ **Phase 2**: State Management & Chess Logic (Zustand + Chess.js)
‚úÖ **Phase 3**: 3D Scene Setup (React Three Fiber + Lighting)
‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Chess Pieces 3D Models (Geometric shapes + Materials)
‚úÖ **Phase 5**: User Interaction System (Selection + Movement hooks)
‚úÖ **Phase 6**: Game Flow Integration (UI Components + Status)
‚úÖ **Phase 7**: Visual Polish & Effects (Animations + Camera controls)
‚úÖ **Phase 8**: Testing & Optimization (Performance + Mobile)
‚úÖ **Phase 9**: Deployment & Final Verification (Vercel + Documentation)

## Final Deliverables
- ‚úÖ Complete 3D Chess Game with full functionality
- ‚úÖ Professional documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT, TESTING)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (11 test files)
- ‚úÖ Production-optimized build configuration
- ‚úÖ Zero-config Vercel deployment ready
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized with React.memo and code splitting

## Project Status
**üèÜ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

The 3D Chess Game is fully functional, tested, optimized, and ready for deployment. All requirements from CLAUDE.md have been met:

- ‚úÖ TDD methodology followed throughout
- ‚úÖ PLAN.md steps executed in sequence  
- ‚úÖ Tech stack adhered to (React, Three.js, Vite, Zustand, Chess.js)
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment ready with zero configuration

## Next Steps for User
1. **Deploy to Production**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md instructions
2. **Quality Assurance**: Use TESTING_CHECKLIST.md for verification
3. **Customization**: Modify components as needed
4. **Maintenance**: Monitor performance and user feedback

## Context for Future AI Sessions
This is a complete, production-ready 3D chess game. All major features implemented:
- Full chess gameplay with rule validation
- 3D interactive board with animations  
- Multiple camera views and controls
